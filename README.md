This Python script creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for converting weights from kilograms to grams, pounds, and ounces using Tkinter. The GUI consists of an input field for entering weight in kilograms, labels for each unit of measurement, and a button to perform the conversion. When the "Convert" button is clicked, the script calculates the equivalent weights in grams, pounds, and ounces, and displays the results in separate text fields.
